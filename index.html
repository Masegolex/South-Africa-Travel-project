            <h2>Why Cape Town</h2>
            <h3>Cape Town is the Mother City</h3>

            <p>
              Cape Town is home to some of the most beautiful beaches on the
              planet. The city straddles the freezing Atlantic Ocean and the
              slightly warmer Indian Ocean, so your choice of beach may be
              determined by how badly you want to swim. It may not be the Med,
              but Atlantic seaboard beaches like Llandudno, Clifton and Campos
              Bay are so stunning that it’s worth a day there with only the
              occasional toe dipped in the water. False Bay beaches like
              surfer’s paradise Muizenberg and the tidal pools of St James are
              best for families. One of the most unique things to do in Cape
              Town is visit Boulders Beach where you can see hundreds of
              resident African penguins nesting along the shoreline.
            </p>

              If you’re a foodie or a wine connoisseur, you’ll be bowled over by
              the superb options available in Cape Town. Cape Town is a melting
              pot of cuisines and deserves its reputation as the food & wine
              capital of South Africa. From traditional dishes like bobotie
              (curried meat with fruit) and potjie (meat and vegetables
              slow-cooked over a fire in an iron pot) to the freshest seafood
              imaginable, you’ll be hard-pressed to name your favourite dish of
              your holiday. If you spend time with locals, expect to while away
              warm summer evenings over a braai (barbecue), where your hosts
              will display an impressive ability to cook just about anything to
              perfection over an open flame.
